= The Diaspora data model - OMG it's a graph!

Sarah Mei recently wrote a http://www.sarahmei.com/blog/2013/11/11/why-you-should-never-use-mongodb/[blog post] describing how she and her colleagues modelled a TV show and a social network, and as I read more of the post it felt like both domains were very graphy in nature.

We wanted to see if our intuition was right (we love the Diaspora project and extend our help to you) and so with the help of http://docs.neo4j.org/chunked/preview/cypher-query-lang.html[Cypher], created a mini version of each of the domains that Sarah described.

The TV show model is as follows:

//graph


== All info for a show

For a particular TV show, show  all the seasons and all the episodes and all the reviews and all the cast members from that show i.e. all of the information connected to that TV show.

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (tvShow:TVShow)-[:HAS_SEASON]->(season)-[:HAS_EPISODE]->(episode)
WHERE tvShow.name = "How I Met Your Mother"
RETURN season, episode
----

//table

We could also grab the reviews if there are any by slightly tweaking the query:

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (tvShow:TVShow)-[:HAS_SEASON]->(season)-[:HAS_EPISODE]->(episode)
WHERE tvShow.name = "How I Met Your Mother"
WITH season, episode
MATCH episode-[?:HAS_REVIEW]->(review)
RETURN season, episode, review
----

//table

== Chronological listing of all episodes

Sarah’s next query was:

Display a chronological listing of all of the episodes of all the different shows that an actor had ever been in.

First let’s add another TV show that Josh Radnor appeared in:

[source,cypher]
----
CREATE (er:TVShow {name: "ER"})
CREATE (er_s9:Season {name: "ER S7"})
CREATE (er_s9_e17:Episode {name: "Peter's Progress"})
CREATE (tedMosby:Character {name: "The Advocate "})

CREATE UNIQUE (er)-[:HAS_SEASON]->(er_s9)
CREATE UNIQUE (er_s7)-[:HAS_EPISODE]->(er_s9_e17)

WITH er_s9_e17

MATCH (actor:Actor), (episode:Episode)
WHERE actor.name = "Josh Radnor" AND episode.name = "Peter's Progress"
WITH actor, episode

CREATE (keith {name: "Keith"})
CREATE UNIQUE (actor)-[:PLAYED_CHARACTER]->(keith)
CREATE UNIQUE (episode)-[:FEATURED_CHARACTER]->(keith)
----

And now we’ll create a query to find the shows that he’s appeared in:

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (actor:Actor)-[:PLAYED_CHARACTER]->(character)<-[:FEATURED_CHARACTER]-(episode)
WHERE actor.name = "Josh Radnor"
RETURN episode.name, character.name
----
//table

We could then easily add in more seasons, episodes and reviews if we wanted to.
