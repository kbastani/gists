== Time Scale Event Meta Model ==

"Time is a dimension in which events can be ordered from the past through the present into the future." - via http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time

Recently at the GraphConnect 2013 conference in San Francisco, many questions were asked about how to handle temporal or time-based traversals in a Neo4j graph database.

The goal of this GraphGist is to provide you with a lens to help you see information as simple temporal facts that are captured across space and time.

Graph databases like Neo4j are not just a traditional data store. Rather, graph databases are an entirely new paradigm that aids a person in capturing meaning from the world as relativistic information described by connected data. 

=== What is relativistic information? ===

Relatvistic information is actually meaning. Unconnected data has no meaning. Only when you connect data can you better describe what it actually means.

Observations are made, captured, from a perspective of a position in time and space. A graph is a model of that space.

A graph database provides you a means to model space and see information from the perspective of a point relative to other points. Those points can represent a condition or state of the world.

Consider the example below. 

* Pam met Sally.
* John met Sally.
* Sally met Anne.
* Anne met Pam.

Each point on the graph is from the perspective of a person relative to meeting other people.

The need to understand these nodes temporally, ordered linearly as time-based events, starts with modeling time as a graph.

=== What is a time graph? ===

Time is a hierarchical model of categorization that enables the back-referencing or prediction of events on a timeline that moves forward in a single direction.

In the time scale graph that is modeled above, a shortest path traversal from a blue colored node to the transparent colored node constitutes a unique time identity in bits.

The identity traced by the red path is 0->1->0->1->0->0. The reverse path is 0->0->1->0->1->0 or simply 001010, a unique identity in bits.

One of the most powerful use cases for traversals in a graph database is the need to model the recurrence relations of past events as they relate to future events. 


=== What is an event graph? ===

An event is any feature or characteristic that describes the state of the world in the past, present, or future.

Furthermore, an event is described by an arbitrary set of features that generalize on the properties contained across all possible events.

This means that an event is only meaningful by connecting it to data that describes it. By attaching a set of features, represented by nodes in the graph, it is possible to attribute meaning to a set of temporal events.

A feature is further described by an arbitrary set of classes that generalize on its combinatorial or shared characteristics. In other words, two or more features can be grouped into a class that generalizes its characteristics at a group level.

The image below represents a time scale connected to a series of events (met). Events, represented as triangular nodes in the image, are also connected to a hierarchy of features (John, Sally, Pam, Anne) which are then further generalized into classes (Person).

This causality graph models the basic structure for determining the role of one event in time to another.

"Causality (also referred to as causation[1]) is the relation between an event (the cause) and a second event (the effect), where the second event is understood as a consequence of the first." via http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causality
