"Time is a dimension in which events can be ordered from the past through the present into the future." - via http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time

Recently at the GraphConnect 2013 conference in San Francisco, many questions were asked about how to handle temporal or time-based traversals in a Neo4j graph database.

The goal of this GraphGist is to provide you with a lens to help you see information as simple temporal facts that are captured across space and time.

Graph databases like Neo4j are not just a traditional data store. Rather, graph databases are an entirely new paradigm that aids a person in capturing meaning from the world as relativistic information described by connected data. 

What is relativistic information?

Meaning.

Observations are made, captured, from a perspective of a position in time and space. A graph is a model of that space.

A graph database provides you a means to model space and see information from the perspective of a point relative to other points. Those points can represent a condition or state of the world.

Time is a hierarchical model of categorization that enables the back-referencing or prediction of events on a timeline that moves forward in a single direction.

One of the most powerful use cases for traversals in a graph database is the need to model the recurrence relations of past events as they relate to future events.

So what is an event?

An event is any feature or characteristic that describes the state of the world in the past, present, or future.


== Include a query console

+//console+

becomes:

//console

== Define a http://docs.neo4j.org/chunked/snapshot/cypher-query-lang.html[Cypher] query

 [source,cypher]
 ----
 CREATE (n{name:'cypher'})-[r:LIKES]->({name:'icecream'})
 RETURN n.name, r
 ----

becomes:

[source,cypher]
----
CREATE (n{name:'cypher'})-[r:LIKES]->({name:'icecream'})
RETURN n.name, r
----

_Queries are executed in the order they appear on the page during rendering, so make sure they can be performed in that order._
If you have a _setup query,_ it normally makes most sense to define it as the first query on the page.
If it takes up too much space, hide it (see below for information on this).
Each query has a green or red button to indicate if the query was successful or not.
The console is set up after the executions, with an empty database, for the reader to play around with the queries.

There's three additional settings you can use for queries.
They all go as comments, on their own lines, before the query.
The settings are:

[width="50%",cols="1m,5"]
|===
| hide | Hide the query. The reader can still expand it to see it.
  Useful for long queries like setting up initial data.
| setup | Initialize the console with this query.
| output | Show the output from the query.
  The output is always there, but this option makes it visible at page load for this query.
|===

Let's try all the settings together, which means this query will be used to initialize the console, it will be hidden, and the raw output will be shown:

 //hide
 //setup
 //output
 [source,cypher]
 ----
 CREATE (n{name:'neo4j'})-[:LIKES]->({name:'complex data'})
 RETURN n.name
 ----

which becomes:

//hide
//setup
//output
[source,cypher]
----
CREATE (n{name:'neo4j'})-[:LIKES]->({name:'complex data'})
RETURN n.name
----

[NOTE]
The test run will always run the queries from top to bottom, so it usually makes sense to have the setup query as the first query.

== Show a graph visualization

The visualization is based on the database contents after the preceding query in the page.

+//graph+

becomes:

//graph

== Show a result table for a query

This will show a result table for the preceding query.

+//table+

becomes:

//table

== Query with error ==

This is what happens if a query causes an error:

[source,cypher]
----
CREATE (n{name:'cypher'}
----

== Basic AsciiDoc formatting

[width="50%",cols="1m,1a"]

Monospaced block: indent lines with one space.

Tables are well supported.
See http://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-quick-reference/[AsciiDoc Quick Reference] for information on that and more.


== Mathematical formulas

When using Math formulas, put them into a source block using LaTex syntax with `\(` as a start delimiter.

The end delimiter is `\)`.
The delimiters and the content between them should be placed in a AsciiDoc passthrough block without attribute substitution.
The formulas are rendered through http://www.mathjax.org/demos/tex-samples/[MathJAX], supported commands are http://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/tex.html#supported-latex-commands[here].
